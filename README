unfurl is an attempt to speed up and simplify writing Perl scripts.

The method is a hybrid of Forth and Perl, with some ad hoc features
thrown in.

As in Forth, a program consists of an input stream, the computation
happens on a stack, and functions ("words") are stored in a dictionary.

As in Perl, certain tokens take on special meanings at runtime,
depending on their appearance--typically marked by a "sigil".

Virtues of Forth other than simplicity and concision--e.g. size and
efficiency--are absent. unfurl is at most as light and fast as Perl, and
Perl-friendliness is the priority. Moreover, all of it is interpreted,
though the word "compilation" is occasionally used in the docs.

unfurl is written in Perl. It depends on nothing but the base
installation of Perl 5.8.

The present version is very Unix-centric.
