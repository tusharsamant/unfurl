unfurl is an attempt to speed up and simplify writing Perl scripts.

The method is a hybrid of Forth and Perl, with some ad hoc features thrown in.

As in Forth, the script consists of an input stream, the computation
happens on a stack, and functions ("words") are stored in a dictionary.

As in Perl, certain tokens take on special meanings at runtime, depending on
their appearance--typically a "sigil".

Other qualities of Forth--e.g. smallness and efficiency--are absent. unfurl
is only as light and fast as Perl, and Perl-friendliness is the priority,
not theoretical purity.

unfurl is written in Perl. There are no dependencies--the base installation
of Perl 5.8 is enough to run it.

The present version is very Unix-centric.

Please read doc/intro to start using unfurl.
