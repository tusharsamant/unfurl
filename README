unfurl is an attempt to speed up and simplify writing Perl scripts.

The method is a hybrid of Forth and Perl, with some ad hoc features thrown in.

As in Forth, the script consists of an input stream, the computation
happens on a stack, and functions ("words") are stored in a dictionary.

As in Perl, certain tokens take on special meanings at runtime, depending on
their appearance--typically a "sigil".

Other qualities of Forth--e.g. smallness and efficiency--are absent. unfurl
is only as light and fast as Perl, and Perl-friendliness is the priority,
not theoretical purity.

unfurl is written in Perl. There are no dependencies--the base installation
of Perl 5.8 is enough to run it.

The present version is very Unix-centric.


USING UNFURL

The syntax of unfurl is minimal: the script is a sequence of
whitespace-separated tokens, with the exceptions being single-quoted
and double-quoted strings. Everything from a # sign to the end of
line is ignored, unless the # is in a quoted string.

An example script:

  #!/usr/bin/env unfurl
  'Hello, ' 'World' . print "\n" print

The tokens are two strings, followed by ".", "print", another string, and
"print" again. The Forth-ish model adopted in unfurl consists of a single
stack of values that starts off empty. The effect of a literal is to push
it on the stack.

The "." token has no literal value, nor a magic ("sigil") meaning as will
be described, so its effect is to look it up in the dictionary. unfurl's
built-in dictionary defines it as the equivalent of Perl string
concatenation.

Overall, the stack, which had two strings on it, changes as follows: the
top two values are popped, the concatenation applied, and the result 
pushed on the stack.

"print" is another built-in: it takes a single value off the top of the
stack and prints it. It returns nothing to the stack.

By this time, "Hello, World" has been printed and there is nothing on
the stack.

The next token is a double-quoted string--the  effect is that a string with
a single newline is now pushed on the stack. The "print" following it takes
it off the stack and prints it.

The script is complete and exits.


MORE EXAMPLES

  #!/usr/bin/env unfurl
  1 2 3 + print "\n" print

This will print 5 and a newline. 1 will remain on the stack at exit time.

  3 * print

This gives an underflow error: the built-in * expects two arguments.

Since printing a newline after anything seems to be a common need, we may
define this:

  { print "\n" print } :say

This introduces a couple of new concepts. First, the token "{" has special
meaning--it starts "compiling" the following tokens. The stack does not
change. The compilation proceeds all the way to "}", where it ends. The
resulting code reference ("anonymous function") is now placed on the stack.

Thus the effect of the code before the ":say" token is to leave an
anonymous function on the stack. As for ":say", the colon is a magic
sigil, which expects a code reference and binds it to the name
following ":".

Overall, this line defines a new function called "say" and the stack
is left empty.

Now you can use "say" anywhere you might have wanted to use the more
laborious code:

  "Hello, World" say

is equivalent to

  "Hello, World" print "\n" print


VARIABLES

Analogous to function definition, unfurl has variable assignment.

  4 >i

The ">" sigil assigns to the variable i (creating it if necessary)
the value on the stack. Following the above assignment,

  i 2 *

will leave 8 on the stack, since the token i has now a defined meaning,
namely the current value of i. To define an i-incrementing token, you
could now say:

  { i 1 + >i } :incr-i

Any occurence of incr-i as a token will now do the intended.


WARNING

Something like

  {i 1 + >i}    # wrong

will raise an error. This is because the first token is "{i", which has no
meaning. Whitespace is all-important in unfurl--it is more or less the only
important thing. This Forth-like convention keeps things simple.


ASIDE

  { 1 + } :incr

is a fine definition of a word that increments whatever is on stack.
What if you did this, instead?

  { 1 + } >incr1

This will assign to the variable incr1 the code for incrementing. To
run it you will have to do

  incr1 execute

and this is equivalent in every way to plain incr. It may be necessary
to use this form sometimes (e.g. in map or reduce); it is basically
deferred code.


PERL MAGIC

There are two more types of token which need no pre-defined meaning
and are interpreted magically. To begin with:

  Text::CSV

This has the sequence '::'--unfurl hence adds the Perl module Text::CSV to a
separate stack of modules. The token has no effect on the main stack or the
rest of the input stream.

The first thing you would have to do with this "module stack" is to load
them:

  XML::Simple Text::CSV require

require is a built-in that loads all modules in the module stack and clears
the module stack.

If the module is top-level, you can make unfurl understand it by prepending
'::'. Example:

  ::Storable require


MORE PERL MAGIC

The '.' sigil denotes a method, which is looked up at runtime and hence
doesn't need to be pre-defined:

  Data::Table [] .new >table

Will create a variable table, and assign the equivalent of Data::Table->new()
to it. Later:

  table [] .html print

will have the effect of print($table->html()).


ARRAYS

What is the [] doing in there? This is the current way to pass arguments to
the method call. The token [] places an empty array (arrayref) on the stack.
The .method form expects two things on the stack, the object (or class), and
an arguments array. The current way to create a non-empty array is:

  [] 1 , 2 , 3 ,

This looks Forth-ish enough: the "," token has the effect of a push, thus []
1 , leaves a one-element array on the stack. More complex arrays are easy:

  [] 1 , "text" , [] 5 , 6 , , "end" ,

Will leave the equivalent of [1, "text", [5, 6], "end"] on the stack.
"{}", similarly, is an empty hash.

These interfaces will undergo changes, hopefully unifying a number
of common data structures. As a foretaste:

  {} >a_hash
  a_hash "key1" "value1" !
  a_hash "key1" @ print       # prints value1
  a_hash "key1" "newval" @!   # assigns newval, leaves value1 on stack

  [] >an_array
  an_array 'a' , 'b' ,
  an_array 1 @ print
  an_array 5 'number_five' !
  an_array 5 'numero_cinco' @!


PERMUTATIONS

The final pair of tokens with special meaning are the parenthesis marks.
Just as braces delimit a function, parentheses delimit a special kind of
function: a permutation, which rearranges the stack near its top. An
example:

  "2010-05" 114 "Bob" "Accounting" 300
  ( id name dept expense -- expense dept name )

will change the stack to:

  "2010-05" 300 "Accounting" "Bob"

Presumably a previous function left 5 values on stack, of which only
4 are needed, and in another order.

The tokens id, name, dept etc have unrelated meanings inside and outside the
permutation.

Some ancient stack twiddling functions rewritten in this fashion:

  { ( a -- a a ) } :dup
  { ( a b -- b a ) } :swap
  { ( a b c -- b c a ) } :rot
  { ( a b c d -- c d a b ) } :2swap

etc.
